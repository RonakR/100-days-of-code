# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through a project on my Github that I haven't touched in ages but I am extremely close to finsihing. Updated the dependancies, fixed a bug with adding new champions. Refactored the code in that project to follow the Standard JS guidelines, but then did some research and decided to go with Airbnb's JS style guide so re-refactored the code. 

**Thoughts** Standards are in place this time, time to add the last of the features to this bad boy and ship it.

### Day 2: January 4th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Removed keys from the code and added a config file. 

**Thoughts** Can't believe I didn't have a config before. Next need to add Winston for logging.

**Today's Progress**: Added winston logging, and updated angular code to follow airbnb.
